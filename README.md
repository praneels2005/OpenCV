**OpenCV Facial Feature Detection & Analysis**

This project utilizes OpenCV and NumPy, along with pre-trained machine learning models, to detect human facial features such as eyes, face, and nose. 
The detected features are then processed and passed to Google Gemini, which performs facial feature analysis and provides improvement tips.

**Features:**
**Facial Feature Detection** – Uses OpenCV and ML models to identify eyes, face, and nose.

**AI-Powered Analysis** – Sends detected features to Google Gemini for evaluation and enhancement suggestions.

**Dynamic Face Filters (Development)** – Future development will introduce real-time image manipulation, allowing users to apply filters that adjust RSV, RGB, hue, saturation, and other image properties.
